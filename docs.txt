	The first result of "Travis CI" on Google is travis-ci.org
	travis-ci.org only contains public projects, so you will want to go to travisci.com, which contains private projects
	click on the + next to "running", make sure you click on the correct organization or your own account, and select the repository you want to test
	create .travis. yml in the root directory and fill it according to this tutorial http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/
